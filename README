This script uses dmenu and wmctrl to mimic the emacs 'switch-to-buffer' command within (almost) any linux window manager.

To use this script you will need the following packages installed on your system:

- ruby
- dmenu
- wmctrl
- xdotool

The script is currently just a hack and works on my debian system. Use the following command to install the required packages:

	sudo apt-get install ruby dmenu wmctrl xdotool

Use the following command to run the script: 
	ruby windowswitch/windowswitch.rb

To change between application windows, I've used wmctrl. Check out their website for a list of supported window managers (http://tomas.styblo.name/wmctrl/)
